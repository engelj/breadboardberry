Bread Board Berry
=================
A quick experiment to combine a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian GNU Linux, a breadboard and some attic electronic parts. Mix that with Nodejs, Expressjs, jQuery, stur well and *Voila* there is your breadboard web interface ;-) .

Most time consuming was collecting together all the hardware on a cloudy public holiday, a few hours later, the LED was flashing and the DIL switch showed up as "on/off" on the browser.

Architecture
------------
As part of this experiment I used <http://coffeescript.org/> to see how well it works for rapid development. The software part consists of `htp.coffee` which is the server backend and `ac.coffee` which is the client frontend. They periodically communicate via AJAX to update screen and hardware.

The software follows a single-page-app-like approach using object-oriented code on the frontend. This may not be efficient in general but comes in handy when customizing the web interface for specific breadboard hardware fixtures later on.

On the Pi, GPIO access requires you to enter/setup root credentials. However, the server is able to run on hardware without the Pi's GPIO (dummy mode). In this case no root access is required. This may speed up development.

For GPIO, two popular npm modules (rpio and gpio) were found. They both have their issues, I finally used gpio but left rpio commented if needed some day.

Prerequisites
-----------
Compile <http://nodejs.org/> on the Pi / cross-compile it on your desktop. Make sure that `init.sh` sets the `PATH` to your nodejs installation's `bin`. I used nodejs/0.8.21 .

Initialization
--------------
Open a shell and issue:
```
cd breadboardberry
. init.sh
```

Clean Up
--------
`make clean`

Compile
-------
`make`

Extra step on Raspberry Pi
--------------------------
As `rpio` and `gpio` npm modules do only compile on the Pi, they are not part of the `package.json` file. As such you need to manually install/update them as needed.

Once:
`npm install rpio gpio`

For an update:
`npm update rpio gpio`

Run
---
Make sure the run target in `Makefile` uses `sudo` when on Raspberry Pi, then
`make run`

To stop, type Ctrl-c .

Flaws / ToDo
------------
1. no realtime solution - this means that updates are limited to a few times per second max. Also be prepared that any CPU interrupts harm timing you might hope to see.
 1. Polling style refresh of the GPIO reading is used. This could be replaced by websockets / socket.io .
 1. No realtime kernel, no dedicated kernel driver with interrupt management. Either use a real time kernel or use some Arduino style hardware towards the breadboard. 
1. Root access need of the overall HTTP server: This is required to gain access to GPIO hardware. Here a kernel driver would be way more elegant and safe. For lab conditions this may not be harmful, but never expose the server to unknown networks!
1. Tests? Ah, right. Yep - there should be some ;-)
